mi canción favorita: birdmad girl - the cure
This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning burning deep inside
Night time night time
Sets my house on fire
I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life
To feel I feel desire
Oh I should feel
Like a polar bear...
It's impossible
She flies outside this cage
Singing girl mad words
I keep her dark thoughts deep inside
As black as stone
And mad as birds
Wild wild wild
And never turn away
Sends me all her love
She sends me everything
She sends me…

One of my favourite songs is:

______________________________

What's Up (4 Non Blondes)
______________________________

[Verse 1]
25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
