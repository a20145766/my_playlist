mi canción favorita: birdmad girl - the cure
This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning burning deep inside
Night time night time
Sets my house on fire
I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life
To feel I feel desire
Oh I should feel
Like a polar bear...
It's impossible
She flies outside this cage
Singing girl mad words
I keep her dark thoughts deep inside
As black as stone
And mad as birds
Wild wild wild
And never turn away
Sends me all her love
She sends me everything
She sends me…

Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band an' all (Stop)
Back there by the baby grand, did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk?"
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought
I fantasise, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits, the chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shinin' city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (Stop)
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die
"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This…
