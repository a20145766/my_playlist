mi canción favorita: birdmad girl - the cure
This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning burning deep inside
Night time night time
Sets my house on fire
I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life
To feel I feel desire
Oh I should feel
Like a polar bear...
It's impossible
She flies outside this cage
Singing girl mad words
I keep her dark thoughts deep inside
As black as stone
And mad as birds
Wild wild wild
And never turn away
Sends me all her love
She sends me everything
She sends me…

It's been a while since I felt this way about someone
I'd really really like to know you more, know you more
Oh your eyes they sing a song to me
And I'd really really like to move to it, groove
And I will open my heart
And I will only for you
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh yeah
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh
And I will open my heart
And I will only for you
And I just don't know what to do
My head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired of trying
And I just don't know what to do
My head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired of trying
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh yeah
Oh your eyes they're spinning 'round my head
And oh, oh this light is on, ooh yeah, on, ooh
And I will open my heart
And I will only for you
